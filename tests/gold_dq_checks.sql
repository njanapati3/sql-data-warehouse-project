Data Quality & Integrity Checks: Gold Layer
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script performs comprehensive Data Quality (DQ) tests on the final 
    Gold layer of the Data Warehouse. 
    
    The goal is to validate the integrity of the Star Schema, ensuring that 
    the Dimension and Fact tables meet fundamental warehouse standards before 
    consumption by BI tools.

Validation Checks:
    1. Primary Key Uniqueness: Verifies that 'customer_key' and 'product_key' 
       are unique in their respective dimensions, ensuring no grain-level 
       duplicates.
    2. Referential Integrity: Checks for "Orphaned Records" in the Fact table. 
       Validates that every Sales record successfully joins to an existing 
       Customer and Product key.
    3. Model Connectivity: Ensures the integrity of the foreign key relationships 
       between the Fact (gold.fact_sales) and Dimensions (gold.dim_customers, 
       gold.dim_products).

Expectation:
    All queries should return zero results. Any returned rows indicate a 
    breakdown in the ETL logic or data consistency issues in the Silver layer.
